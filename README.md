# Superstore-Sales-Analysis

# Project Summary â€“ Superstore Sales Analysis:

- This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail superstore dataset to uncover trends in customer behavior, sales performance, and product distribution. 

- Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed customer segmentation, loyalty analysis, and identified key product and regional sales trends.

- The analysis provided data-driven insights including the identification of high-value customers, top-performing product categories, and underperforming regions, all visualized through compelling graphs and charts.

- This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and interpret large datasets to inform strategic business decisions.
